### Testing Procedure 

1. Ssh to one of the Shared Services hosts (either NLB :8033 or :8044)
   1. Ping the other SharedServices host 
2. Realize the pings donâ€™t work b/c MSR routes are not in place on the Shared Services Web Tier RTs 
   1. 10.100.4.0/22 Local CIDR needs a new Next Hop in RT for Sub01 & Sub02 
      1. Sub01 route should oppose the 10.100.5.0/24 VPCE 
      2. Sub02 route should oppose the Sub01 VPCE
