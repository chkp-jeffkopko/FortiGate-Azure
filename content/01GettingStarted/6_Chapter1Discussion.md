## ![Customer-Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortinetSecDevOps/technical-recipe-azure-sdwan/main/images/demo_play.png) ***Discussion Points During a Demo - Chapter 1***

Fortinet provides a large library of infrastructure as code (IaC) templates to deploy baseline and iterate POC and production environments in public cloud.  IaC support includes Terraform, Ansible, and cloud-specific services such as Azure ARM, AWS Cloudformation, and Google Deployment (jinja) templates. Terraform Providers are available for FortiGate and FortiManager to insert and iterate running configuration.

For more information, review the following:

* [FortiOS 7.2 Admin Guide](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.2/administration-guide/763117/terraform-fortios-as-a-provider)

* [Terraform Providers](https://fndn.fortinet.net/index.php?/cloud/terraform/)

## Key questions during your demo - Chapter 1

When giving this TEChnical Recipe as as demo, the following questions will provide a basis for next steps and future meetings:

* Has your organization standardized on an IaC tool-set for infrastructure provisioning and iteration?
* How are the responsibilities for infrastructure assigned?  Does cloud network fall under a DevOps, Cloud Networking, or Application Delivery team, as examples?
* What is view on how IaC can improve workflows?
* Is workflow automation in cloud and cross-organizational collaboration important within your cloud business?
