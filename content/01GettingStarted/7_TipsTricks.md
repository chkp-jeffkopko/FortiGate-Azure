# Tips and Tricks

### Helpful Items 

- [AWS Blogs for GWLB ](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/category/networking-content-delivery/elastic-load-balancing/gateway-load-balancer/) 
- [Check Point SK for GWLB Architectures](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk174447&partition=Basic&product=CloudGuard)
- Repetitive testing tool for AL2 CLI: [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) 
```commandline
yum install httpd-tools
for i in {1..100}; do ab -n 1000 -c 100Â http://www.google.com; done
```

### Gateway Load Balancer Limitations & Considerations

1. Flow Stickiness 
   1. Currently GWLB flow hashing default 5 Tuple (TCP) and 4 Tuple (UDP)
      - Multi layered protocols may be hashed differently 
   2. Currently flows are sticky for their lifetime.  If an appliance crashes, the application must re-establish TCP flow 
2. FLOW idle timeouts 
   1. Currently fixed and unchangable 
      - 350s for TCP 
      - 120s for UDP 
3. No VPN 
   -  Currently Check Point does not support VPN with GWLB architectures 
4. Cost 
   - GWLB & GWLBe both have per hour per AZ costs & a Data charge
