# Testing procedure

### Login to test instances 

The test instances are secured by inbound GWLB flows.  To access the instance, you will need to use the Load Balancer DNS names and EC2 Private keys provided in Cloudformation Output

 Use the DNS name above to login via SSH(using Putty or Terminal) with the Private key provided to the following EC2 instancesâ€¦**be sure to note the special port being used for the DB and Shared Services instances**
   - DB instance:  dnsname:8022 
   - Shared Services instance #1:  dnsname:8033
   - Shared Services instance #2:  dnsname:8044
   - Web-Tier instance:  Public IP as defined by the CFT
